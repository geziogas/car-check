Car-Check / A car garage-service company software.
=========

As a mandatory part of my bachelor course , "Object Oriented Programming", 
we had to implement a software for a car service garage.  
It should include all functions of a real life software like adding the responsible engineer, 
adding clients, adding new tabs for new clients including description of the car's problem, 
results after the car check-up or after fixing the problem, etc. 
It should save all the information to files, which could be accessed later, 
whenever the "secretary" or the "car engineer" needed to do so.  
Simple error checks, wrong data input check, and other informative statuses were implemented.  
"Car Check" software was implemented in JAVA. GUI, was written in Java Swing.

Unfortunately right now the project is implemented with greeklish (greek-english) naming in the code.
It is planned in the future, the full translation and update of the project.
